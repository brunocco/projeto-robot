# My Robot Automation

The project uses the Robot Framework for test automation on the website https://www.saucedemo.com/. 
Robot Framework is an open-source test automation tool, especially useful for acceptance testing and end-to-end testing. 
It uses a simple, keyword-driven syntax that makes test creation and reading straightforward. 
With support for various libraries and integration with other tools, it is widely used in QA projects to validate software functionality.
